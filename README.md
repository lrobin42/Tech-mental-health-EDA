# Tech-mental-health-EDA

## Project Overview

### Project Goal
The tech mental health survey used within this project was offered from 2014-2019, excluding the year 2015. Our department believes that there a good business case to resume this survey beginning next year, so you have been tasked with performing exploratory data analysis on historical data within our databases so that we can redesign the survey to resume research later this year. 

### Project Approach
We will investigate the findings of this multi-year survey through the lens of how to revamp it to be more statistically rigorous, more dense with insights, and more useful for our goal of answering the following research questions. 

### Research questions
- Are tech workers more likely than other workers to have mental health problems? 
- Do tech workers have mental health resources available, and if so do they use them? 
- Do workers trust that their privacy will be protected? Do they fear career reprisals?
- Do they feel that mental health is valued in their workplace?
